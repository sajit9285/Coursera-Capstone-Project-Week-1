    "Canada is a one of the most popular destination of Indian Engineering Students for advance studies and also for doing Internships like Mitacs etc. When new students go there, they usually miss the Indian foods badly, because of unique taste of native foods.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "This Project is aimed to help them in finding <strong>the best Indian restaurants in Toronto, the provincial capital of Ontario, Canada</strong>. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose Toronto, because, the highest concentrations of Indo-Canadians are found in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, followed by growing communities in Alberta and Quebec as well, with the majority of them being foreign-born."

Then, filtering out all the venues that have Indian restaurants. I will analyse ratings, tips and count for Indian restaurants. I will sort that data and visualize the ranking of neighborhoods using <strong>folium library</strong> of Python.   \n"
